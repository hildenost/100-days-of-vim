# 100 days of Vim

Inspired by the #100DaysOfCode challenge, I've decided to do a 100 days of Vim challenge.

## Overall goal

Gaining proficiency in using Vim.

### Minor goals
* Set up a `.vimrc` file that suits my needs
* Set up a personal web site

## Rules

I am committing myself to work in Vim as the editor for small projects for 1 hour per day during the course of 100 days.

**Start date**: August 16 2018

1. I will occasionally update my Instagram based on my progress
2. If I work on Vim on my daytime job, that counts towards the challenge
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so anyone can see my progress
4. I will update the log with the day's progress
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges

_Comments to the rules:_
1. I don't want to torment my followers with this project of mine
2. The goal is to be better at Vim, so any work with Vim counts
