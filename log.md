## Day 1: Thursday August 16 2018

### Today's progress
* Added `set number` to my `.vimrc` file
* Edited Readme.md and log.md using vim
* Installed hugo, wrote an *About* page in vim, and failed deploying it

### Key bindings used
`h`-`j`-`k`-`l` left - down - up - right keys for moving the cursor

`r`- `R` replacing 1 or more characters

`x` deleting character under cursor

`o` - `a` **o**pen new line or **a**ppend

### What hindered me?
I replaced some longish text with some shorter text. I want to delete from that spot until end of line.
